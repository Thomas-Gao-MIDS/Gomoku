# Gomoku

The Gomoku project is written as part of MIDS Python course with the objective to demonstrate understanding of OOP. In this little program, user can initiate two bots to play Go against each other. Bots follow a set of simple rules defined in the Strategy class. More elaborate rules can be defined, and in future, code can be used to train bots through adverserial learning.
