The Gomoku project is written as part of MIDS Python course with the objective to demonstrate understanding of OOP. In this little program, users can choose to play against each other, play against a bot, or have two bots play against each other. Bots follow a set of pre-defined rules in the Strategy class. Set of rules can be expanded, and in future perhaps code can be used to train bots through adverserial learning. 

The program can be initialized on the command line using the arguments below.
